"""Tests for parse_landscape_xml_into_state() — issue
SecuritySilverbacks/SAPMAP#105.

Covers three cases a real SAPGUILandscape.xml / SAP UI Landscape XML can carry:
  (A) <Service msid="…"/> linked to a <Messageserver uuid="…"/> with a real
      `systemid="SID"` attribute                                  → real SID
  (B) <Service msid="…"/> linked to a <Messageserver uuid="…"/> but with
      the SAP Logon placeholder `systemid="@01"` ("SID unknown")  → placeholder
  (C) <Service server="host:port"/> direct-connect, no messageserver link
      (the common case in SAPGUILandscape.xml exports)            → placeholder

Pre-#105 the importer only handled (A); (B) was imported with the literal
"@01" as SID, and (C) was silently dropped.  Both bugs manifested in the
operator's screenshot (only ONE node named "@01" after importing a 70-entry
landscape XML with multiple real SAP systems).
