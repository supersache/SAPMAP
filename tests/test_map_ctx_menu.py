"""Tests for the empty-map right-click context menu.

Locks the per-vulnerability "Check All XX" menu entries:

  * Each entry has an `id` attribute used by showMapCtxMenu to
    gate visibility on the presence of eligible target nodes.
    Without this, the operator sees no-op entries that would
    iterate zero candidates.

  * Each entry's click handler maps to a JS function that
    eventually fires the matching backend endpoint.

  * Each backend endpoint exists.

Operator scenario: open SAPMAP, scan a landscape with only ABAP
nodes (no Java).  The "Check All CVE-2025-31324" entry must not
appear in the right-click menu — there's nothing to scan against.
Same for CVE-2020-6287, ICMAD, etc.

These tests guard against future refactors silently dropping a
menu entry, gating signal, click-handler case, or backend
endpoint.
